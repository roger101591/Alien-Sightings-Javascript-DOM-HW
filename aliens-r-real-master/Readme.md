# Unit 14 | Assignment - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at **www.ALIENS-R-REAL.com** have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem though... Our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

That's why we are hiring you. We need you to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a [dataset we provide](Data/data.js). We also need to allow our users to search through the table for specific pieces of information. There's a catch though... We only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS on our web pages. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted.

You can handle this... Right? The planet Earth needs to know what we have found!

### Assignment Description

* Create a basic HTML web page.

An HTML page was created to allow search a user to enter search terms. Then the page will populate search results of UFO sightings from the data provided in the json objects in the data file.
There are multiple search criteria that allow for the user to specify UFO sightings. Entering in more search terms will narrow the results.

Fields included in the search:
  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
